    ConflictNotification:
      type: object
      description: Notification of conflict with new/modified operations or intersection with constraints.
      required:
        - intersection_detected_at
        - notification_sent_at
        - impacted_flight_id

        intersection_detected_at:
          anyOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Time'
          description: >-
            Time at which the intersection with other operational_intents or constraints was detected by USS.
            Conflict Notification to user can be sent in two scenarios. For the purpose of tests, 
            the value of intersection_detected_at is described below for these two cases.
             - USS managing flights for a user, maintains awareness of any new or modified operational intents.
            It responds with 204 for any notification received for new or modified operation to the notifying USS, 
            and checks if any conflict exists. The time the USS responds with 204 will be taken as the value of intersection_detected_at.
             - USS creates a new flight or modifies an existing flight for user through UpsertFlightPlan. 
            USS checks for conflicts with existing operational intents in order to create or modify the flight.
            When successful, the USS responds back with 200 and a planning result as Completed. 
            The time USS responds with 200 will be taken as the value of intersection_detected_at.
        notification_sent_at:
          anyOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Time'
          description: Time at which the user was notified about the conflict or intersection.
        impacted_flight_id:
          description: Flight_id of the user flight that is impacted by the conflict.

        conflicts_count:
          description: >-  
            Number of conflicting operational intents reported by the notification.
            If the user notification is triggered as a result of creating or modifying a flight, the conflicts_count
            can have value greater than 1, depending on number of conflicting operations detected.
            If the user notification is triggered by receipt of notification of a new or modified
            operational intent from another USS, the conflicts_count value is 1.                        
            If not provided, the default value is 0, which would mean there are only constraints intersecting

        conflict_entity_ids:
          description: >-
            These are the ids of the conflicting entities. This field is kept optional as some USSes might not share
            conflict entity ids like operation entity id or constraint id.

        constraints:
          description: >-
            List of constraints that intersect with a flight. 
            It would contain one constraint when triggered by notification of a constraint from another USS.
            It could contain multiple constraints when triggered by creation or modification of a flight.
